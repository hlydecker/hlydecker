## Hi, I'm Henry 

**Program Manager in Artificial Intelligence | Data Scientist | AI Strategy & Governance Specialist**

I'm an experienced AI leader with a background in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and strategy. I help organizations harness the power of AI technologies to drive business transformation while ensuring responsible and ethical use.

In my current role, I lead AI strategy and initiatives at the University of Sydney. We're working to transform Australia's oldest university, the **18th best** globally, **2nd in Australia**, to:
- provide the best possible experience for 70,000 students,
- enable our reseachers to solve the world's greatest problems, and
- make it a better place to work for all of our 26,000 staff.

So far we've done phenomenally, winning **AI University of the Year** from Future Campus and being recognised domestically and internationally as a leader in AI adoption. 

Before my current role, I did a PhD in Ecology where I honed my skills in using machine learning and statistics to parse noisy data and understand complex systems. After leaving academic research, I worked as a Data Scientist consulting to researchers and public sector, developing innovative solutions for clients from agriculture, geology, healthcare, and law enforcement just to name a few. I then led a team of Data Scientists and Software Engineers, developing AI products for researchers and public sector clients.
