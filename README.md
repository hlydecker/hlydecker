## Hi, I'm Henry 

**Program Manager in Artificial Intelligence | Data Scientist | AI Strategy & Governance Specialist**

I'm an experienced AI leader with a background in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and strategy. I help organizations harness the power of AI technologies to drive business transformation while ensuring responsible and ethical use.

In my current role, I lead AI strategy and initiatives at the University of Sydney. We're working to transform Australia's oldest university, the 18th best globally, 2nd in Australia, to provide the best possible experience for 70,000 students, enable our reseachers to solve the world's greatest problems, and make it a better place to work for all of our 26,000 staff. So far we've done phenomenally, winning AI University of the Year from Future Campus and being recognised domestically and internationally as a leader in AI adoption.
